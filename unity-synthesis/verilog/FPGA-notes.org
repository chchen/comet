* How to program a Intel Cyclone FPGA on an Arduino Vidor MKR4000 Board

** Required Software

- Windows or Linux
- Intel Quartus FPGA IDE
- Arduino IDE with Vidor MKR4000 Libraries
- The vidorcvt utility, which is available from
-- https://github.com/wd5gnr/VidorFPGA

** General Flow

1. You define a project in the Quartus Software
2. The Quartus Software compiles your design into an output file
3. Convert the output file into a ttf file using Quartus
4. Incorporate the ttf file's contents into a Arduino project's app.h file
5. Program the Arduino MKR 4000 board, which uploads your new project to the FPGA

** Pin Assignments
